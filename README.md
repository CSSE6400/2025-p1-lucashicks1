# CSSE6400 Week 1 Practical

Construction of a simple HTTP server in Python.

This is a simple flask app that you can run using the following:

```bash
flask --app todo run
```

> [!NOTE]  
> You may face issues with starting this server if you have not installed all of the required dependencies. To install them, simplify use `poetry install`. If you don't have poetry visit [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) or maybe even try out uv :)
